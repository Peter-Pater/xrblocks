/**
 * NetObject: an Object3D wrapper whose transform is replicated to all other
 * peers on a fixed cadence. The peer that *creates* the NetObject becomes
 * its initial owner; other peers may "claim" it (e.g., when grabbed) by
 * calling `claim()`. The current owner is the only peer that broadcasts
 * authoritative transform updates; non-owners interpolate.
 *
 * Ownership is cooperative — there is no central arbiter. Explicit claims
 * always preempt the previous owner so users can hand off / steal objects;
 * the only deterministic tiebreak left is for the rare case where two peers
 * implicitly auto-own the same id at create-time (see NetSession's
 * `netobject` handler), where the lex-smaller peer id wins.
 *
 * NetObjects are normal three.js Object3Ds; you can `.add()` any meshes to
 * them. Each frame, NetSession applies remote updates to the local
 * transform if we don't currently own the object.
